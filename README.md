# JPISActivities

JPIS Activities was built to help the school's hundreds of students discover the school's extracurricualar offerings, charter new activities themselves, and manage their clubsâ€”all on one platform. In addition to these features, there is the use of SMTP technology to help club leaders inform members of upcoming meetings and for them to maintain lines of communication through private and group messaging channels which was built using Django Sockets. There should also be credit given to the open source templates used in the creation of calendar page and the landing pages.
